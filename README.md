# Blogy- write and post blogs

* this project is just for revision purpose and I completed 21 challenge till now.
* topics covered:
    * ejs
    * node-express

* used [lodash](https://lodash.com/) library for route parameter formatting
* "/posts/post-title" will take you to the full post page
* write post in "/compose" and it will be reflected in home page.
* very basic paragraph formatting(ellipsis, showing only preview, separate page for every post)

**Note:** on refreshing the page data will be lost (no db is used till now).
